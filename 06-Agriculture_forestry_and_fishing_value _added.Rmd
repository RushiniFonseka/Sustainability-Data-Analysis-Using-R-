#interpretation: based on the data shows the agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP) for France, Germany, and Greece.The observations are,France: The value added by agriculture, forestry, and fishing has steadily declined in France, from over 5% of GDP in 1960 to around 1.9% in 2022.Germany: Similar to France, Germany has also seen a decline in the contribution of this sector to its GDP, from around 5% in 1960 to around 0.9% in 2022.Greece: Compared to France and Germany, Greece has a larger share of its GDP coming from agriculture, forestry, and fishing. While there have been fluctuations, it has generally remained above 3% throughout the period, reaching around 3.8% in 2022.
