#interpretation:the graph you shows the annual freshwater withdrawals for France, Germany, and Greece as a percentage of their total internal resources from 1960 to 2023.France:Freshwater withdrawals have fluctuated over time, with no clear upward or downward trend. The average annual withdrawal is around 13% of total internal resources.Withdrawals were highest in 1962, at 17%, and lowest in 2019, at 11%.Germany:Similar to France, Germany's freshwater withdrawals also fluctuate without a clear trend. The average annual withdrawal is around 11% of total internal resources.Withdrawals were highest in 1986, at 15%, and lowest in 1997, at 8%.Greece:Compared to France and Germany, Greece has consistently withdrawn the least amount of freshwater as a percentage of its internal resources. The average annual withdrawal is around 6%.Withdrawals have slightly increased over time, with the highest withdrawal recorded in 2011, at 9%, and the lowest in 1960, at 4%.
