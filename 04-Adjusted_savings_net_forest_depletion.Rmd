#interpretation: the graph is showing Adjusted savings: net forest depletion(% of GNI) over the period of 1960-2023 years in France.The graph has a visible fluctuation over the time while 1960-1970 and around 2000-2020 maintained a same level near 0.05 % of GNI.The figure went sky rocketed until hit the 0.124631 % of GNI after the year 1970 and eventually it has decreases till 2000 and hit the bottom with accounting 0.007643% of GNI.considering the box plot, most of the values are above the average 0.06115 % and overall the figure has a moderate negative relationship with the values and years.
